        "Donald Trump, the 45th president of the United States, was impeached for the second time by the House of Representatives on January 13, 2021, one week before his term was due to expire. Trump's impeachment came amid his attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election;  the adopted article of \"incitement of insurrection\" cited his January 2 phone call with Brad Raffensperger and alleged that Trump incited the storming of the United States Capitol one week prior.[1] He is the only U.S. president (and the only holder of any federal office) to have been impeached twice, the previous time in December 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.[2][3]",
        "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would impeach Trump for instigating \"an armed insurrection against America\" if his Cabinet did not strip him of his powers and duties using the 25th Amendment.[4] On January 11, Pelosi gave Vice President Mike Pence an ultimatum to invoke the 25th Amendment within 24 hours or the House would proceed with impeachment proceedings.[5] On January 12, in a letter to Pelosi, Pence made it clear that he would not invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, arguing that doing so would not \"be in the best interest of our Nation or consistent with our Constitution\".[6] Nevertheless, a majority of the House of Representatives, including one Republican, passed a resolution urging Pence to either invoke the 25th Amendment or have the House majority impeach Trump.[7]",
        "On January 11, 2021, an article of impeachment charging Trump with \"incitement of insurrection\" against the U.S. government and \"lawless action at the Capitol\" was introduced to the House of Representatives.[8] The article was introduced with more than 200 co-sponsors.[9]"

Its remit additionally covers investigation into the records of and the practices at an additional thirteen Mother and Baby Homes.

        "Following widespread news reports in 2014 that the bodies of 796 babies and children may have been interred in an unrecorded mass grave at the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, County Galway, there were calls both nationally and internationally for an investigation of the site, and for an inquiry into all such Mother and Baby Homes.[7]"

        "The COVID-19 recession is a severe global economic crisis which has caused a recession in some nations and in others a depression.[which?] It is the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression. The crisis began due to the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first major sign of a recession was the collapse of markets during the 2020 stock market crash, which began in late February and lasted through March.[1][2][3][4][5][6] But the stock market crash was short-lived, and many market indices around the world recovered or set new records by the northern autumn 2020.  By September 2020, every advanced economy had fallen to recession or depression, whilst all emerging economies are in recession.[7][8][9] Modeling by the World Bank suggests that in some regions a full recovery will not be achieved until 2025 or beyond.[10][11][12][13]",
        "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to more than a third of the world's population being placed on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19.[14] It has caused severe repercussions for economies across the world,[15] following soon after a global economic slowdown during 2019 that saw stagnation of stock markets and consumer activity worldwide.[16][17]",
        "The recession has seen unusually high and rapid increases in unemployment in many countries, and the inability in the United States for state-funded unemployment insurance computer systems and processes to keep up with applications.[18][19]  By October, more than 10 million unemployment cases had been filed in the United States.[20] California State University has brought up an initiative of releasing nationwide remote opportunities to benefit the citizens of the United States.[21] The United Nations (UN) predicted in April 2020 that global unemployment will wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020—equivalent to 195 million full-time workers.[22] In some countries, unemployment is expected to be at around 10%, with more severely affected nations from the COVID-19 pandemic having higher unemployment rates.[23][24][25] The developing world is also being affected by a drop in remittances,[26] exacerbating global food crises.[27]"

        "The FinCEN Files are leaked documents from the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), that have been investigated by BuzzFeed News and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), and globally publicised on 20 September 2020.[1][2] The reports describe over 200,000 suspicious financial transactions valued at over US$2 trillion that occurred from 1999 to 2017 across multiple global financial institutions.[1] The documents appear to show that while both the banks and the United States Government had this financial intelligence, they did little to stop activities such as money laundering.[1] The information implicates financial institutions in more than 170 countries who played a role in facilitating money laundering and other fraudulent crimes.[1] Journalists around the world have criticized both the banks and the US government, the BBC stating it shows how the \"world's biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world\", and BuzzFeed News claiming the files \"offer an unprecedented view of global financial corruption, the banks enabling it, and the government agencies that watch as it flourishes.\"[1][3]",
        "FinCEN is a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury that collects and analyses information to combat money laundering, terrorism financing, evasion of economic sanctions and other financial crimes. FinCEN collates suspicious activity reports (SARs), reports required to be filed by financial institutions when they suspect their clients are engaging in financial crime.[3] Unauthorized disclosure of a SAR is a US Federal criminal offense, as it could undermine or hamper ongoing investigations, and threaten the safety of financial institutions and those who file the SARs.[4][5] SARs are not evidence of a crime, but the FinCEN claims they provide vital information to investigate crimes.[1] FinCEN collected more than 2 million SARs last year, but their staff has decreased by 10% from 2009 to 2019.[1][6][7] BuzzFeed News sources also include that most SARs are not read or acted upon. While banks are required to file a SAR when they are dealing with suspicious activity, they must still take actions themselves; filing a SAR is not the only thing the bank does to deal with corruption or money laundering.[1]",
        "BuzzFeed News obtained the 2,657 leaked documents, including 2,121 SARs, in 2019 and shared them with the ICIJ.[8][1][2][3] 400 journalists from 88 countries proceeded to investigate the leaks which were brought to the public's attention on 20 September 2020.[8] BuzzFeed News and the ICIJ state that the files flag over 200,000 transactions dating from 1999 to 2017, worth a total of US$2 trillion dollars.[9] Furthermore, they noted that the findings may not be representative of all SARs, as the files received are less than 0.02% of the more than 12 million SARs that financial institutions filed with FinCEN during this time.[10][2] The Miami Herald said that the files \"are the most detailed U.S. Treasury records ever leaked.\"[11]"

Several vaccines are being developed and distributed. Current treatments focus on addressing symptoms while work is underway to develop therapeutic drugs that inhibit the virus.

While this cycle is normally reliable, anomalies in the climate—such as El Niño events—disrupt the region's annual level of rainfall;[5] this, in turn, causes the decline of the region's plant life, the lowering of water levels in bodies of water and a loss of moisture from the soil, with the latter effect causing a drought.[6]"

        "The 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, also known as Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement, were triggered by the introduction of the Fugitive Offenders amendment bill by the Hong Kong government. The now-aborted bill would have allowed extradition to jurisdictions with which Hong Kong did not have extradition agreements, including mainland China and Taiwan. This led to concerns that Hong Kong residents and visitors would be exposed to the legal system of mainland China, thereby undermining Hong Kong's autonomy and infringing civil liberties. It set off a chain of protest actions that began with a sit-in at the government headquarters on 15 March 2019, a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9 June 2019, followed by a gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex to stall the bill's second reading on 12 June which escalated into violence that caught the world's attention.",
        "On 16 June, just one day after the Hong Kong government suspended the bill, an even bigger protest took place to push for its complete withdrawal and in reaction to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12 June. As the protests progressed, citizens laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into alleged police brutality and misconduct, the release of all the arrested, a retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and the resignation of Carrie Lam as chief executive along with the introduction of universal suffrage in the territory. Police inaction when suspected triad members assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long on 21 July and the police storming of Prince Edward station on 31 August further escalated the protests.",
        "Lam withdrew the bill on 4 September, but refused to concede the other four demands. Exactly one month later, she invoked the emergency powers to implement an anti-mask law, to counterproductive effect. Confrontations escalated and intensified – police brutality and misconduct allegations increased, while some protesters started using petrol bombs and vandalising pro-Beijing establishments and symbols representing the government. Rifts within society widened and activists from both sides assaulted each other. The storming of the Legislative Council in July 2019, the deaths of Chow Tsz-lok and Luo Changqing, the shooting of an unarmed protester, and the sieges of two universities in November 2019 were landmark events."

After two months of protests, farmer unions—notably from Punjab and Haryana—began a movement named Dilhi Chalo (transl. Let's go to Delhi), in which tens of thousands of farming union members marched towards the nation's capital. The Indian government ordered the police and law enforcement of various states to attack the farmer unions using water cannons, batons, and tear gas to prevent the farmer unions from entering into Haryana first and then Delhi. On 26 November a nationwide general strike that involved approximately 250 million people took place in support of the farmer unions.[11] On 30 November, it was estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 farmers were converging at various border points on the way to Delhi.[12]",
        "A section of farmer unions have been protesting, whereas the Indian Government claims some unions have come out in support of the farm laws.[13][14] Transport unions representing over 14 million trucker drivers have come out in support of the farmer unions, threatening to halt movement of supplies in certain states.[15] After the government did not accept the farmer unions' demands during talks on 4 December, the farmer unions planned to escalate the action to another India-wide strike on 8 December 2020. The government offered some amendments in laws, but unions are asking to repeal the laws.[16] From 12 December, farmer unions took over highway toll plazas in Haryana and allowed free movement of vehicles.[17]"

Demonstrations had begun in 13 January 2020 while the then-bill, claimed by the government as vital to boosting the country's manufacturing industry and foreign investment, was still being drafted.

The new proposed draft titled RUU Cipta Kerja (Job Creation Bill) was fiercely opposed by environmentalists, labour unions, and many oppositions shortly after its publication.[15][16][17] The first draft was proposed on 12 February 2020. It contained 15 chapters and 174 articles to be discussed by the People's Representative Council (DPR) during the 2020 National Legislation Program.[18] The bill was passed on 5 October 2020.[19]",
        "The law sparked protests, originating in Java in January 2020.[21] Protesters are concerned that the law could hurt both workers, specifically that it \"would harm workers by reducing severance pay, cutting mandatory leave, allowing longer work hours, and permitting the hiring of contract and part-time workers in place of full-time employees\"; and the environment, specifically that it \"would lead to the destruction of primary rain forests that are essential in controlling carbon emissions and slowing climate change\" according to environmentalists.[19] Several labour unions say that the law should include representatives from labour unions and not just investors.[22] The government says that the law could help Indonesia's fallen economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 8 October, at least 400 protesters have been detained, ranging from peaceful protesters to rioters.[23]"

About 28 million tweets bearing the hashtag have been accumulated on Twitter alone.[8] Solidarity protests and demonstrations by Nigerians in diaspora and sympathizers occurred in many major cities of the world. The protests is notable for its patronage by a demographic that is made of entirely young Nigerians.[9][10] The movement has since expanded to include demands for good and accountable governance.",

The move was widely received as a triumph of the demonstrations.[11] However, it was noted in many quarters that similar announcements had been made in recent years to pacify the public without the unit actually being disbanded, and that the government had merely planned to reassign and review SARS officers to medical centres rather than disband the unit entirely.[12] Protests have continued accordingly, and the Nigerian government has maintained a pattern of violent repression including the killing of demonstrators.[13] There have been international demonstrations in solidarity with those happening in the country, and the movement has also grown increasingly critical of Muhammadu Buhari's government response to the protests.[14]",
        "SARS officers have been alleged to profile young Nigerians, mostly males, based on fashion choices, tattoos and hairstyles. They were also known to mount illegal road blocks, conduct unwarranted checks and searches, arrest and detain without warrant or trial, rape women, and extort young male Nigerians for driving exotic vehicles and using laptops and iPhones.[15] Nigerians have shared both stories and video evidence of how officers of SARS engaged in kidnapping, murder, theft, rape, torture, unlawful arrests, humiliation, unlawful detention, extrajudicial killings and extortion of Nigerian citizens.

Kata'ib Hezbollah responded with an attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, which prompted the U.S. to deploy hundreds of new troops to the Middle East and announce that it would preemptively target Iran's \"proxies\" in Iraq. Days later, the commander of IRGC's Quds Force Qasem Soleimani and PMF commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were both killed in a U.S. drone strike, resulting in Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei pledging to exact revenge on U.S. forces.

        "The 2020–21 United States election protests are an ongoing series of protests across multiple cities in the United States following the 2020 United States presidential election between incumbent President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden. The election was held on November 3, 2020. Biden won the election, receiving 81.3 million votes (51.3%) to Trump's 74.2 million (46.9%)[21][22] and winning the Electoral College by 306 to 232.[23][22][21] Biden's victory became clear on November 7, after the ballots (including mail-in ballots) had been tabulated.[24] The Electoral College voted on December 14, in accordance with the law, formalizing Biden's victory.[23]",
        "Before and after the election, Trump and his Trump campaign and allies baselessly challenged the legitimacy of the election and falsely claimed widespread electoral fraud.[25] Trump and his allies filed dozens of legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges from across the political spectrum, in both the state and federal courts, including by federal judges appointed by Trump himself. The courts found that Trump's claims had no factual or legal basis.[26][27] Trump's unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voting fraud were also refuted by state election officials.[28]",
        "Pro-Trump groups, with the backing of Trump himself, engaged in multiple street protests and demonstrations decrying the election results and echoing Trump's false claim of election fraud.[5] These protests have taken place in Washington, D.C., state capitals, and other locations nationwide; they have included pro-Trump Proud Boys protesters. In November and December 2020, there were nighttime clashes and street scuffles in Washington between Trump supporters who refused to accept the president's defeat, including Proud Boys, and counterprotesters.[5][29][30]"

        "The 2020–2021 United States racial unrest is an ongoing wave of civil unrest, comprising protests and riots, against systemic racism towards black people in the United States, notably in the form of police violence. It is partly facilitated by the nationwide Black Lives Matter movement, and was initially triggered by the killing of George Floyd during his arrest by Minneapolis police officers on May 25, 2020. Following the death of George Floyd, unrest broke out in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area on May 26, and quickly spread across the country and the world. Within Minneapolis, widespread property destruction and looting occurred, including a police station being overrun by demonstrators and set on fire, causing the Minnesota National Guard to be activated and deployed on May 28. After a week of unrest, over $500 million in property damage was reported in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area and two deaths had been linked to the riots.[9][10][11][12]",
        "Further unrest quickly spread throughout the United States, sometimes including rioting, looting, and arson. By early June, at least 200 American cities had imposed curfews, while more than 30 states and Washington, D.C, had activated over 62,000 National Guard personnel in response to unrest.[13][14][15] By the end of June, at least 14,000 people had been arrested at protests.[16][17][18] Polls have estimated that between 15 million and 26 million people had participated at some point in the demonstrations in the United States, making them the largest protests in United States history.[19][20][21] It was also estimated that between May 26 and August 22, around 93% of protests were \"peaceful and nondestructive\".[22][23] According to several studies and analysis, protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful, with police and counter-protesters sometimes starting violence.[24][25][26] According to a September 2020 estimate, arson, vandalism and looting caused about $1–2 billion in insured damage between May 26 and June 8, making this initial phase of the George Floyd protests the civil disorder event with the highest recorded damage in United States history.[8][27]",
        "There has also been a large concentration of unrest around Portland, Oregon, which has led to the Department of Homeland Security deploying federal agents in the city from June onward. The move was code named Operation Legend, after 4 year old LeGend Taliferro, who was shot and killed in Kansas City.[28] Federal forces have since also been deployed in other cities which have faced large amounts of unrest, including Kansas City and Seattle.[29][30][31][32] More localized unrest reemerged in several cities following incidents involving police officers, notably following the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, which led to protests and riots in the city.  The protests have led to requests at the federal, state and municipal levels intended to combat police misconduct, systemic racism, qualified immunity and police brutality in the United States.[33][34] A wave of monument removals and name changes has taken place throughout the world, especially in the United States. This itself has sparked conflict, between left-wing and right-wing groups, often violent. Several far-right groups, including civilian militias and white supremacists, have fought with members of \"a broad coalition of leftist anti-racist groups\" in street clashes.[35]"

        "A crisis concerning the identity of the legitimate president of Venezuela has been underway since 10 January 2019, with the nation and the world divided in support for Nicolás Maduro or Juan Guaidó. The process and results of the 20 May 2018 presidential election were widely disputed.[1][2] The opposition-majority National Assembly declared Maduro a \"usurper\" of the presidency on the day of his second inauguration and disclosed a plan to set forth its president Guaidó as the succeeding acting president of the country under article 233 of the Venezuelan Constitution.[2][5] A week later, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice declared that the presidency of the National Assembly was the \"usurper\" of authority and declared the body to be unconstitutional.[2]",
        "Minutes after Maduro took the oath as president, the Organization of American States (OAS) approved a resolution in a special session of its Permanent Council declaring Maduro's presidency illegitimate and urging new elections.[6] Special meetings of the OAS on 24 January and in the United Nations Security Council on 26 January were held but no consensus was reached. Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres called for dialogue.[7] During the 49th General Assembly of the Organization of American States on 27 June, Guaidó's presidency was recognized by the organization.[8] Guaidó declared himself acting president and swore himself in on 23 January.[4] Maduro's government has accused the United States of organizing a coup d'état to remove him and take control of the country's oil reserves.[9] Guaidó rejects the characterization of his actions as a coup, saying that his movement is backed by peaceful volunteers.[10]",
        "Guaidó was recognized as legitimate by about 60 countries; Maduro by about 20 countries.[11][12][13] Internationally, support has followed traditional geopolitical lines, with allies China, Cuba, Iran, Russia, Syria, and Turkey supporting Maduro, while the majority of Western and Latin American countries supported Guaidó as acting president.[11][14][15] On 5 January 2020, the National Assembly Delegated Committee election resulted in claimed victories by both Guaido and legislator Luis Parra as the president of National Assembly,[16] starting another crisis in the legislative body, in addition to the presidential crisis.[17]"

        "The yellow vests movement or yellow jackets movement (French: Mouvement des gilets jaunes, pronounced [muvmɑ̃ de ʒilɛ ʒon]) is a populist,[64] grassroots[65] protest movement for economic justice[66] that began in France in October 2018. After an online petition posted in May had attracted nearly a million signatures, mass demonstrations began on 17 November.[67] The movement was initially motivated by rising fuel prices and a high cost of living; it claims that a disproportionate burden of the government's tax reforms were falling on the working and middle classes,[68][69][70] especially in rural and peri-urban areas.[32][71] The protesters have called for lower fuel taxes, a reintroduction of the solidarity tax on wealth, a minimum-wage increase, the implementation of Citizens' initiative referendums,[39] among other things. On 29 November 2018, a list of 42 demands was made public and went viral on social media, becoming de facto a structuring basis for the movement, covering a wide range of eclectic topics, mostly related to democracy, social and fiscal justice.[38][72]",
        "The movement spans the political spectrum. According to one poll, few of those protesting had voted for Macron in the 2017 presidential election; many had either not voted, or had voted for far-right or far-left candidates.[73] Rising fuel prices initially sparked the demonstrations. Yellow high-visibility vests, which French law requires all drivers to have in their vehicles and to wear during emergencies, were chosen as \"a unifying thread and call to arms\" because of their convenience, visibility, ubiquity, and association with working-class industries.[74] The protests have involved demonstrations and the blocking of roads and fuel depots, some of which developed into major riots,[75] described as the most violent since those of May 1968;[76] the police response, resulting in multiple incidences of loss of limb, has been criticised by politicians and international media.[77] The movement has received international attention, and protesters in many places around the world—some with similar grievances, others unrelated—have used the yellow vest as a symbol.[78][79]",
        "The issue on which the French movement centred at first was the projected 2019 increase in fuel taxes, particularly on diesel fuel.[80] The yellow vest was an accessible symbol for the protests, as all French drivers have been required to have one in their vehicles since 2008.[74]"

The bishop announced he would be retiring at sixty nine years of age due to ill health and feeling unable to continue to with a fully active ministry.[1] Pope Benedict XVI accepted his resignation as Bishop of Dunkeld on 6 July 2012.[2]"
